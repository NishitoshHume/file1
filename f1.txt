ABSTRACT edit


In this project work and effort has been made to develop a modernized multi blade hacksaw machine and less stress full operation for cutting wood, metal and plastic materials. The aim of this work is to develop a hack saw the performance difference between hands driven, pedal drive and two way hack saw machine. This model implies a conversion of rotary motion of crank to reciprocating motion of hack saw blades. This motion is used for hack saw machine, in this model we can operate five hacksaws at same time. This model will overcome the traditional hack saw machine which done material cutting of single piece at particular times interval and also fulfils the need of more material cutting accounts to mass production. This machine works significantly with minimum vibrations and jerks. This machine will also done cutting of different materials, hence the purpose model of hack saw machines will be welcomed by many industries due to compactness and efficiency. To achieve this goal the multi blade hack saw machine is developed.
